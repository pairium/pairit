# Pairit Project Rules

## Essential Reference Files
Always consult these files for comprehensive project context:
- **@README.md**: Quickstart guide, repo structure, deployment instructions
- **@learnings.md**: AI learnings, implementation insights, debugging tips
- **@todo.md**: Current priorities and development roadmap
- **@docs/**: Complete documentation (architecture, runtime, components, etc.)

## Key Principles
We want to put as much logic into the components as possible and keep the runtime logic light, a barbell approach with a light runtime and and heavy components and config (which can be abstracted away for better dev UX).
