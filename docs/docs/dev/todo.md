# Todo

- [ ] add back button
- [ ] firestore events
- [ ] simplify runtime
  > strip redundant logic from the normalizer. i want to keep the runtime minimal. when we add new properties and components, can we just add it to the component and the config? i don't want the runtime to care about the specific components, just some abstractions of the components. and capture a note in the docs that future additions should live in components plus config when possible.
