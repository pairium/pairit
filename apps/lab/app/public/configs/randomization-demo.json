Each group has equal probability of any condition.\nSimple but may result in unbalanced groups, especially with small samples.\n\n**2. Balanced Random**\nAssigns to the condition with fewest groups so far.\nEnsures equal distribution while maintaining unpredictability.\n\n**3. Block**\nRound-robin through conditions: A, B, A, B, A, B...\nDeterministic alternation for strict balance.\n"
